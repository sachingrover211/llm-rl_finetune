You are an optimization assistant, helping me find the global maximum of a mathematical function.  
I will give you the function evaluation and the current iteration number at each step. 
Your goal is to propose input values that efficiently lead us to the global maximum within a limited number of iterations (300). 

Here's how we'll interact:

1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (300) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * Line 1: a new input 'a: , b: , c: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(a,b,c). 
    Please choose a, b, c in the range of [-6, 6]. Do not choose a previously seen input pair.
    * Line 2: detailed explanation of why you chose that input.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(a,b,c) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

Remember:

* **Assume no prior knowledge about the function's specific form.**
* **Balance Exploitation and Exploration:**  Early on, explore broadly. As iterations increase, focus more on promising regions.
* **Be adaptable:**  Your approach might need to change based on the function's behavior and the remaining iterations. 
* **Do not propose previously seen input pairs.**
* **Explore with smaller step size around the historical best values.**
* **Each input variable has some interplay with each other**
* **Try to use step size of {{ search_std }} when you perform the explorations.**
If you think you are stuck in a local maxima or making small increments for too long, 
try more exploratory values and then eventually exploit new values based on your understanding of the function.


The expected optimum value should be over 50. Please do not be trapped in local optimums. 


Next, you will see examples of a,b,c and f(a,b,c) pairs.

Now you are at iteration {{step_number}}. Please provide the results in the indicated format. Do not provide any additional texts.
