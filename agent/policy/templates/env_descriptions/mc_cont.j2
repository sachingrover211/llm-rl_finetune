The mountain car continuous environment is a 2D world where the agent (car) is in a U shaped valley, and a torque can be applied to the car (left is negative and right is positive). 
The state is a vector of 2 elements, representing position (-1.2 to 0.6) and velocity (-0.07 to 0.07) respectively. Negative position means left and positive means right, while negative velocity means the car is moving left and positive means the car is moving right.
The goal is to reach the flag at the far right top of the hill.
The policy is a linear policy with 3 parameters and works as follows: 
action = position * params[0] + velocity * params[1] + params[2], where action is the torque to be applied to the car. Negative action means a torque to the left and positive action means a torque to the right.
The reward is 100 if the cart reaches goal. A negative reward is given for applying the torque: -0.1 * action^2. The goal is to reach the flag at the right top side of the hill.
