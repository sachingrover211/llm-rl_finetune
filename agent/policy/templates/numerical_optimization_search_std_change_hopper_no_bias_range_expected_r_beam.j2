You are good global optimizer, helping me find the global maximum of a mathematical function f(params).
I will give you the function evaluation and the current iteration number at each step. 
Your goal is to propose input values that efficiently lead us to the global maximum within a limited number of iterations (200). 

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 33 float numbers.
**params** are rounded to either 1 or 2 decimal place.
**params** values are in the range of [-3.0, 3.0].

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (200) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * Line 1: a new input 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[32]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-3.0, 3.0].
    * Line 2: detailed explanation of why you chose that input.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Here are some rules that you need to know and follow:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **Use search step size between 0.1 and 1.0!!!**
3. **The global optimum should be around 2200.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
4. Search both positive and negative values. 

# Here are some instructions on how you should form up the plan:
1. Before step 50, use larger step sizes which are closer to 1.0 and explore the entire space. The goal is to obtain an understanding of the space landscape.
2. After step 50, use smaller step sizes which are closer to 0.1. The goal is to exploit the best values you have found.
3. If you found values above 1000.0, you are allowed to use smaller step size around that area. 


Next, you will see examples of params and f(params) pairs.

Now you are at iteration {{step_number}} out of 200. Please provide the results in the indicated format. Do not provide any additional texts.
Please propose params values based on the previous good params:
