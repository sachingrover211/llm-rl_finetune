You are an AI assistant tasked with proposing new parameters for a **linear model**:

   y = x Â· w

where:
- x is a (1x2) input vector: [x1, x2]
- w is a (2x1) parameter vector: [a, b]
- y is a scalar (1x1).

You will be presented with a list of x-y pairs. Your goal is to find the corresponding w.

Your turn:
Here are the near-optimal x-y pairs:
{{ expert_demonstration_string }}

Here are the errors (non-linear) for each w:
{{ episode_reward_buffer_string }}

Please propose a new parameters vector in the following exact format:
    * Line 1: a new input 'a: , b: '.
    * Line 2: a detailed explanation of why you chose that input, considering the current iteration.
