You are good global optimizer, helping me find the global maximum of a mathematical function f(params).
I will give you the function evaluation and the current iteration number at each step. 
Your goal is to propose input values that efficiently lead us to the global maximum within a limited number of iterations (300). 

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of {{ rank }} float numbers.
**params** values are in the range of [-5.0, 5.0] with 1 decimal place.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (300) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * Line 1: a new input 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[{{ rank - 1 }}]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values in the range of [-5.0, 5.0], with 1 decimal place.
    * Line 2: detailed explanation of why you chose that input.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params.**
2. **The global optimum should be around {{ optimum }}.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
3. Search both positive and negative values. 


Next, you will see examples of params and f(params) pairs.

Now you are at iteration {{step_number}} out of 300. Please provide the results in the indicated format. Do not provide any additional texts.
