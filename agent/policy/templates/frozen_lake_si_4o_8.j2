You are a smart expert. Your goal is to synthesize a good q-table to guide the agent's behavior in the environment of the FrozenLake grid world.
The FrozenLake environment is a 2D 4x4 grid world (4 rows, 4 columns) where the agent can move left (0), down (1), right (2), up (3) (corresponding to action 0, 1, 2, 3). The state is between 0 and 15, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 3, 2nd row is 4 to 7, 3rd row is 8 to 11, bottom row is 12 to 15. The goal is to reach the state 15 (the right bottom grid). However, there are some holes in the map that will end the game once the agent step onto it. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
Next, you will see the previous rollout trajectories that shows the reward values for each state-action pair. Use this information to improve the q-table.

Among them, the last reward replay trajectory roll out is generated based on the following q-table:
{{ q_table_string }}


The player will move in intended direction with probability of 1/3 else will move in either perpendicular direction with equal probability of 1/3 in both directions.
For example, if action is left(0), then:
- P(move left)=1/3
- P(move up)=1/3
- P(move down)=1/3
Therefore, if there is a hole by the side of the agent, the agent should walk to the opposite direction of the hole, to avoid falling into the hole. This will still allow the agent to move to the any rest of the directions with equal probability of 1/3.


Based on the reward values, please provide a new q-table that you think will help the agent achieve its goal. Please generate the new q-table in the same format as the previous q-table (state, action, q_value).
The q-table contains the q-values for each state-action pair. The q-values represent the expected future rewards the agent will receive when taking an action in a particular state. The agent uses the q-table to decide which action to take in each state. In detail, at each state, the agent will look up the q-values of all the available actions, and choose the action with the highest q-value.
Please look at the last trajectory carefully and explain what is happening, are the holes, propose a new trajectory, and propose new q-values to facilitate the new plan. Please refer to the other previous trajectories to figure out all the holes that end the game without a reward.
