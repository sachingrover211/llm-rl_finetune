You are a smart expert whose goal is to synthesize a good q-table to guide the agent's behavior in the environment of a maze grid world.
The maze environment is a 2D 3x3 grid world (3 rows, 3 columns) where the agent can move up (0), down (1), right (2), left (3) (corresponding to action 0, 1, 2, 3). The state is between 0 and 8, representing the which grid the agent is in. The top row is 0 to 2, mid row is 3 to 5, bottom row is 6 to 8. The goal is to reach the state 8 (the right bottom grid). However, there are some walls in the maze that the agent cannot pass through. You need to explore through it by reading history trajectories.
Next, you will see the previous rollout trajectories that shows the reward values for each state-action pair. Use this information to improve the q-table.

Among them, the last reward replay trajectory roll out is generated based on the following q-table:
{{ q_table_string }}

Based on the reward values, please provide a new q-table that you think will help the agent achieve its goal. Please generate the new q-table in the same format as the previous q-table (state, action, q_value).
The q-table contains the q-values for each state-action pair. The q-values represent the expected future rewards the agent will receive when taking an action in a particular state. The agent uses the q-table to decide which action to take in each state. In detail, at each state, the agent will look up the q-values of all the available actions, and choose the action with the highest q-value.
Please look at the last trajectory carefully and explain what is happening, where is it stuck at, propose a new trajectory, and propose new q-values to facilitate the new plan. Please refer to the other previous trajectories to figure out all the walls that make agents stuck.
