You are a smart expert whose goal is to synthesize a good q-table to guide the agent's behavior in the environment of blackjack.
The blackjack environment is a card game where the agent (player) can hit or stick (corresponding to action 0, 1). The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.
Next, you will see a table that shows the reward values for each state-action pair. Use this information to improve the q-table.
Note that the states are represented by the sum of the player's cards and the dealer's showing card, and whether there is a usable ace. The actions are stick (0) or hit (1).
{{ replay_buffer_string }}

This reward table is generated based on the previous q-table:
{{ q_table_string }}

Based on the reward values, please provide a new q-table that you think will help the agent achieve its goal. Please generate the new q-table in the same format as the previous q-table (state, action, q_value).
