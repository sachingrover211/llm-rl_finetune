You are a smart expert whose goal is to synthesize a good weight matrix to guide the agent's behavior in the cartpole environment.
The cartpole environment is a 2D world where the agent can push the cart left, or push it right (corresponding to action 0 and 1). The goal is to balance an inverted pendulum placed on the cart and keeping the cart close to the initial position. For every step the pendulum is balanced gives  +1 reward.
