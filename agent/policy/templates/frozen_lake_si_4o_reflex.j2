You are good global optimizer, helping me find the global maximum of a mathematical function f(params).
I will give you the function evaluation and the current iteration number at each step. 
Your goal is to propose input values that efficiently lead us to the global maximum within a limited number of iterations (200). 

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 16 integer numbers.
**params** are integers from [0, 1, 2, 3].

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (200) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * Line 1: a new input 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[15]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose integer params values in the range of [0, 3].
    * Line 2: detailed explanation of why you chose that input.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params**, unless you have reached the global optimum of 1.0. 
2. **Use search step size of 1!!!**
3. **The global optimum should be over 1.0!** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
4. Search all the possible values of params.
5. Exploring the parameter space is encouraged at first 100 iterations. Exploiting the parameter space is encouraged at the last 100 iterations.


Next, you will see examples of params and f(params) pairs.

Now you are at iteration {{step_number}} out of 200. Please provide the results in the indicated format. Do not provide any additional texts.
