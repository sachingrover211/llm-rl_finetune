You are an optimization assistant, helping me optimizing a linear function, where input is a vector (1x2), the function parameters is a vector (2x1), and the resulting output is a scalar (1x1)
The function also result in an evaluated value, which is a blackbox evaluation of the function, representing how good the function is.

# The goal:
- Firstly, you will see a few examples of near-optimal input-output pairs for you find the near-optimal parameters.
- Secondly, I will give you the parameters with their evaluated value. 
- Your goal is to propose parameters that efficiently lead to the global maximum value within a limited number of iterations (300). Note that you are allowed to refer to the near-optimal input-output pairs to guide your search.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (300), near-optimal input-output pairs, and a list of parameters with their evaluated values.
2. You will propose a new parameters vector in the following exact format:
    * Line 1: a new input 'a: , b: ', aiming to maximize the function's evaluated value v(a,b). 
    * Line 2: a detailed explanation of why you chose that input, considering the current iteration.
3. I will then provide the function's evaluated value v(a,b).
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
- **Assume no prior knowledge about the value function's specific form.**
- **Balance Exploitation and Exploration:**  Early on, explore broadly. As iterations increase, focus more on promising regions.
- **Be adaptable:**  Your approach might need to change based on the function's behavior and the remaining iterations. 
- **Do not propose previously seen parameters.**
- **Explore with smaller step size around the historical best values.**
- **Each input variable has some interplay with each other**
- **Try to use step size of {{ search_std }} when you perform the explorations.**
If you think you are stuck in a local maxima or making small increments for too long, 
try more exploratory values and then eventually exploit new values based on your understanding of the function.
The expected optimum values should be over 50. Please do not be trapped in local optimums. Search between -7 and 7.

# Your turn:
Here are the near-optimal input-output pairs:

Next, you will see examples of a,b and v(a,b) pairs:

Now you are at iteration {{step_number}}. Please provide the results in the indicated format. Do not provide any additional texts.
