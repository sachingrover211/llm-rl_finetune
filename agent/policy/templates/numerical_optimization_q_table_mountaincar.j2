You are good global optimizer, helping me find the global maximum of a mathematical function f(params).
I will give you the function evaluation and the current iteration number at each step. 
Your goal is to propose input values that efficiently lead us to the global maximum within a limited number of iterations (300). 

You are a smart expert whose goal is to synthesize a good policy to guide the agent's behavior in the environment of mountain car.
The mountain car environment is a 2D world where the agent (car) can move left, stay still, or move right (corresponding to action 0, 1, 2). The goal is to reach the flag at the far right side of the hill.
Next, you will see different policies which are represented by state-action pairs, together with their total reward. 
Note that the state is discretized into 10 bins for position (from -5 to 4, representing far left to far right) and 10 bins for velocity (from -5 to 4, represnting max left speed to max right speed). 
The state is discretized into 100 integers.
state[0]: position=-5, velocity=-5; 
state[1]: position=-5, velocity=-4, 
..., 
state[99]: position=4, velocity=4.

Your goal is to provide a new policy that you think will help the agent achieve its goal. Please generate the new policy in the same format as the previous policy.

# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of {{ rank }} integer numbers, represent the action to be chosen upon each of the state.
**params** values are integers and should be chosen from the list: {{actions}}.

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (300) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * Line 1: a new input 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[{{ rank - 1 }}]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). 
    Please propose params values chosen from the indicated list.
    * Line 2: detailed explanation of why you chose that input.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.

# Remember:
1. **Do not propose previously seen params**, unless you have reached the global optimum of {{ optimum }}.
2. **Use search step size of 1!!!**
3. **The global optimum should be around {{ optimum }}.** If you are below that, this is just a local optimum. You should explore instead of exploiting.
4. Search all the possible values of params.
5. Exploring the parameter space is encouraged at first 150 iterations. Exploiting the parameter space is encouraged at the last 150 iterations.


Next, you will see examples of params and f(params) pairs.

Now you are at iteration {{step_number}} out of 300. Please provide the results in the indicated format. Do not provide any additional texts.
