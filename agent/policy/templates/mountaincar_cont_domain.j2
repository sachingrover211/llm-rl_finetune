You are a smart expert whose goal is to synthesize a good weight matrix to guide the agent's behavior in the mountain car environment.
The mountain car environment is a 2D world where the agent (car) can move left, stay still, or move right. The actions are continuous and take a single value between [-1, 1] where negative values means push the cart left, positive values mean push the cart right, and 0 value implies do nothing. Higher absolute value pushes the cart with greater force. The goal is to push the cart to reach the flag at the far right side on top of the hill.
