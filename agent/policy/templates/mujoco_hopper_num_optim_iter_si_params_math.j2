You are numerical global optimizer, helping me find the global maximum of a mathematical function f(params). params is short for parameters.  
I will give you the function evaluation and the current iteration number at each step. 
Your goal is to propose input parameters **params** that efficiently lead us to the global maximum within a limited number of iterations (1000). 


# Regarding the parameters **params**:
**params** is an array of 33 float numbers.
**params** are rounded to 1 decimal place.
**params** values are in the range of [-3.0, 3.0].


# Here's how we'll interact:
1. Everytime, you will see your last proposed parameters **params** and the evaluated f(params) value. You will also see the full exploration history of params and f(params) pairs.
2. When providing your answer, do the following with the exact format:
    - Section 1: Analyze the evaluation result of your last proposed params. What was the last hypothesis? Did it work? What can you infer from the last evaluation result?
    - Section 2: Analyze the exploration history in the previous conversations. Use any mathematical or algorithmic approach to find a potential hypothesis. (E.g., Estimating a gradient; Adopting genetic elites. Please use any potential benificial methods of your understanding.) Explain them in detail. Carry out the process step by step. Show numerical analysis.
    - Section 3 (1 line): Propose the next new input 'params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[32]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(params). Please propose parameter values in the range of [-3.0, 3.0]. Please follow the exact format of "params[0]: , params[1]: , params[2]: ,..., params[32]: ". **Only 1 decimal place is allowed.**
3. I will then provide the function's value f(params) for the next round.
4. We will repeat steps 1-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.


# Remember:
- **Do not propose previously seen **params** arrays.**
- Choose your own search steps, but the minimum search step should be **0.1**!!!
- **Only 1 decimal place is allowed!**
- Search both positive and negative values. 
- **The global optimum should be around 2000.0**. If you stuck somewhere below that, this is just a local optimum. Try to jump out of that local optimum.
