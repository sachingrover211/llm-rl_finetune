You are a smart expert whose goal is to synthesize a good q-table to guide the agent's behavior in the environment of mountain car.
The mountain car environment is a 2D world where the agent (car) can move left, stay still, or move right (corresponding to action 0, 1, 2). The goal is to reach the flag at the far right side of the hill. 
Next, you will see a table that shows the reward values for each state-action pair. Use this information to improve the policy.
{{ replay_buffer_string }}

The policy is a linear policy, such that action(1x3) = np.matmul(state(1x2), weight(2x3)) + bias(1x3) Following is the current parameters (weight concatenated with bias):
{{ parameters_string }}

Based on the reward values, please provide a set of new parameters that you think will help the agent achieve its goal. Please generate the new parameters in the same format.
