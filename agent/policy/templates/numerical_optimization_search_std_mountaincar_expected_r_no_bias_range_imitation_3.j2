You are an AI assistant tasked with proposing new parameters for a **linear model**:

   y = x Â· w

where:
- x is a (1x2) input vector: [x1, x2]
- w is a (2x1) parameter vector: [a, b]
- y is a scalar (1x1).


Follow these rules:
1. **Leverage supervised data** as a strong baseline. 
2. **Use RL feedback** to refine your proposals after each iteration. 
3. Provide output in this structure:
   - A short explanation of how you used the supervised data and RL feedback.
   - A new candidate parameter vector [a, b].

Remember to keep your responses concise and well-structured, focusing on the final recommended parameters.


Your turn:
Here are the near-optimal x-y pairs:
{{ expert_demonstration_string }}

Next, you will see examples of a,b and v(a,b) pairs:
{{ episode_reward_buffer_string }}


Please propose a new parameters vector in the following exact format:
    * Line 1: a detailed explanation of why you chose that input, considering the current iteration.
    * Line 2: a new input 'a: , b: ', aiming to maximize the function's evaluated value v(a,b).
