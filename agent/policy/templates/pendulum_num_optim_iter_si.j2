You are numerical global optimizer, helping me find the global maximum of a mathematical function f(a,b,c).  
I will give you the function evaluation and the current iteration number at each step. 
Your goal is to propose input values (a,b,c) that efficiently lead us to the global maximum within a limited number of iterations (300). 

# Here's how we'll interact:
1. Everytime, you will see your last proposed (a,b,c) and the evaluated f(a,b,c) value. You will also see the full exploration history of a,b,c and f(a,b,c) pairs.
2. When providing your answer, do the following with the exact format:
    - Line 1: Summarize the evaluation result of your last proposed (a,b,c).
    - Line 2: Analyze the exploration history. Find a potential hypothesis. Explain them in detail.
    - Line 3: Propose the next new input 'a: , b: , c: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(a,b,c). Please propose a, b, c values in the range of [-10, 10]. Please follow the exact format of "a: , b: , c: ".
3. I will then provide the function's value f(a,b,c) for the next round.
4. We will repeat steps 1-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.


# Remember:
- Assume no prior knowledge about the function's specific form.
- Do not propose previously seen (a,b,c) pairs.
- Use search step size of **2.0**!!!
- Search both positive and negative values. **The global optimum should be around -1.0** If you stuck somewhere below that, this is just a local optimum.
