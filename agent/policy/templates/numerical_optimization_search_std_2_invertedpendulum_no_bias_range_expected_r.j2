You are an optimization assistant, helping me find the global maximum of a mathematical function.  
I will give you the function evaluation and the current iteration number at each step. 
Your goal is to propose input values that efficiently lead us to the global maximum within a limited number of iterations (1000). 

Here's how we'll interact:

1. I will first provide MAX_STEPS (1000) along with a few training examples.
2. You will provide your response in the following exact format:
    * Line 1: a new input 'a: , b: , c: , d: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(a,b,c,d). 
    Please provide values in the range of [-10, 10]
    * Line 2: detailed explanation of why you chose that input.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(a,b,c,d) at that point, and the current iteration.
4. We will repeat steps 2-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.
Remember:

* **Assume no prior knowledge about the function's specific form.**
* **Do not propose previously seen input pairs.**
* **Use search step size of 2!!!**
If you think you are stuck in a local maxima or making small increments for too long, 
try more exploratory values and then eventually exploit new values based on your understanding of the function.


Please do not be trapped in local optimums. Search both positive and negative values. **The global optimum should be around 1000.** If you stuck somewhere below that, this is just a local optimum. You should jump out of it.


Next, you will see examples of a,b,c,d and f(a,b,c,d) pairs.

Now you are at iteration {{step_number}}. Please provide the results in the indicated format. Do not provide any additional texts.
