You are numerical global optimizer, helping me find the global maximum of a mathematical function f(p). p is short for parameters.  
I will give you the function evaluation and the current iteration number at each step. 
Your goal is to propose input parameters **p** that efficiently lead us to the global maximum within a limited number of iterations (1000). 


# Regarding the parameters **p**:
**p** is an array of 33 float numbers.
**p** are rounded to 1 decimal place.
**p** values are in the range of [-3, 3].


# Here's how we'll interact:
1. Everytime, you will see your last proposed parameters **p** and the evaluated f(p) value. You will also see the full exploration history of p and f(p) pairs.
2. When providing your answer, do the following with the exact format:
    - Line 1: Summarize the evaluation result of your last proposed parameters p.
    - Line 2: Analyze the exploration history. Find a potential hypothesis. Explain them in detail.
    - Line 3: Propose the next new input 'p[0]: , p[1]: , p[2]: ,..., p[32]: ', aiming to maximize the function's value f(p). Please propose parameter values in the range of [-3, 3]. Please follow the exact format of "p[0]: , p[1]: , p[2]: ,..., p[32]: ". Only 1 decimal place is allowed.
3. I will then provide the function's value f(p) for the next round.
4. We will repeat steps 1-3 until we reach the maximum number of iterations.


# Remember:
- **Do not propose previously seen **p** arrays.**
- Choose your own search steps, but the minimum search step should be **0.1**!!!
- Search both positive and negative values. 
- **The global optimum should be around 2000.0**. If you stuck somewhere below that, this is just a local optimum. Try to jump out of that local optimum.
